* 2025-04-01 00:10:30 - Completed persistence layer refactoring

## Completed Tasks

*   [2025-04-01 00:10:30] - Refactored persistence layer to separate concerns:
    * Moved XML serialization/deserialization to repositories
    * Removed persistence knowledge from domain models
    * Reorganized test files to match new architecture
*   [2025-03-31 01:38:50] - Created initial data files in `data/` directory.
*   [2025-03-31 01:34:35] - Analyzed repository classes and determined XML data structures.
*   [2025-03-31 01:29:23] - Populated `productContext.md` with initial project overview based on file analysis.
*   [2025-04-03 00:02:20] - Refactored repository layer to encapsulate XML implementation:
    * Moved repository implementations to `lib/repositories/*/xml/` sub-packages.
    * Created factory functions `create_*_repository` in `lib/repositories/*/`.
    * Updated `MainForm.py` and tests to use factory functions.

## Current Tasks

*   

## Next Steps

*   Consider implementing repository interfaces to further decouple persistence implementation
*   Evaluate potential for supporting alternative storage backends
