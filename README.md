# PyEnvelopes #

* Simple application for expense control based on the "envelopes" idea
* `lxml` required for correct work
* Some of the project strings are in Russian
* XML files used as DB storage removed from source as it's moved in public, so one should create all files listed in "manager" classes (`BusinessPlan.py`, `ExpenseManager.py`, `EnvelopeManager.py`, etc.) manually
